' "Specific gravity G  is defined as the ratio of the density of a substance
' to the density of water pw at a specified reference temperature, typically
' 4 C (39 F), where pw  is 1.000 g cm-3(1,000 kg m-3 or 62.43 lb ft-3)." (Wood Handbook)
' Equation from Wood Handbook Chapter 4, page 10-12,  General Technical Report FPL-GTR 190

density = waterdensity * specificgravity * (1 + (moisturecontent / 100#))

End Function
